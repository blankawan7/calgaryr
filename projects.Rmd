### **Ongoing Projects**

Please contact a project lead for participation

1. **Calgary Police Crime Statistics** - This dataset was chosen in our first meeting in 2017.  The purpose was to use it as a common source that members can practice R programming techniques.  We decided in the second meeting to use it for a community year project.

### **Community Service**

We provide statistical services for a non-profit organization located in Calgary.  The workflow of this service as below:

1. Filling out the intake form and email the form to one of organizers <!--[Alice Lam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alice-lam-71796238/){target="_blank"} <<alicelam22@gmail.com>> --> (we are currently preparing the intake form)

2. You are going to be invited to give a background information about the problem of interest for 15 minutes. 

3. A special task team is made up of a small group of volunteers. 

4. An analysis is carried out for three months (by default) up to six months. 

5. The project is listed under the **ongoing projects** section.

6. You are presenting the outcome.  

Note that a service time cannot be asked to be shorten and a quality of service cannot be guaranteed since the only available resources are personal time and efforts from volunteers.
